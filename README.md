# clust3r
clust3r is an interactive manual spike sorting program for extracellular spike waveform data. Clusters are defined by freehand contours drawn in 3D feature space. Semi-automated sorting is possible via template-matching functions. The sort function, clust3r, requires a spiketime vector and waveform matrix as inputs. It operates primarily via internal functions but also calls one external function, clust3r_stats. 

See demo_script for example usage (data provided).
